            Who is the best cook that you know? It is a pretty safe bet most
            people will say their grandma.  Luckily for me I have two grandmas 
            who are amazing cooks and helpful teachers.  Below I have 3 wonderful
            recipes straight from my grandmother's hearts to your kitchen!

        <p class="heading">GUMBO</p>
       
        <ul class="description">
        <li>
            As a young man who has grown up in 
            Louisiana, gumbo has always been a favorite
            dish of mine. <strong><a href="recipes/gumbo.html">Here</a></strong> 
            is my grandma's top secret recipe.

        <ul class="description">
        <li>
            <p>Another Louisiana classic is the thick and hearty red beans
            and rice. <strong><a href="recipes/redbeans.html">Here</a></strong> is a great 
            recipe with a little spice!</p>

        <p class="heading">JAMBALAYA</p>
        
        <ul class="description">
        <li>
            <strong><a href="recipes/jambalaya.html">Jambalaya</a></strong> is a tried and true cajun
            meal consisting of rice, seasonings, and whatever meats you prefer. My favorite is just the 
            classic jambalaya with chicken and sausage!
