# odin-recipes
Odin foundations project

My goal is to create a recipe website with an index and multiple 
links to seperate recipe pages.  I am going to write this with as
much of my own notes and history as possible. I am hoping to showcase
my ability to use html to create a solid base for my website that
I can expand and improve on over time as I learn more.
