        <h3 class="heading">Step by Step Guide</h3>
        <ol class="list">
            <li>Rinse beans, and then soak in a large pot of water overnight.</li>
            <li>The next day when you are ready to begin gather all ingredients</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook onion, bell pepper, celery, and garlic in olive oil for 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Rinse beans, and transfer to a large pot with 8 cups water. Stir cooked vegetables into beans. Season with bay leaves, parsley, thyme, Cajun seasoning, cayenne pepper, and sage. Bring to a boil, and then reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer for 2 1/2 hours.</li>
            <li>Stir sausage into beans, and continue to simmer for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, prepare the rice. Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Once the rice is done you can serve the red beans over the rice.  Keeping these two seperate allows people to get their desired consistency of rice vs beans.</li>
            <li>Enjoy the fruits of your labor!</li>
